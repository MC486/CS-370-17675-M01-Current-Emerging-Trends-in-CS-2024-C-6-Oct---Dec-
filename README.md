# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
Overview
This project showcases the development of an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze to locate treasure using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The primary focus was on applying the key concepts of Deep Q-Learning to train the agent to optimize its pathfinding. The work highlights the integration of exploration, exploitation, and dynamic learning techniques to solve a complex real-world problem.

### Code Provided vs. Code Created
Provided Code: The initial maze structure, helper functions for visualization, and a basic environment setup were provided. These formed the foundation for implementing the intelligent agent.

Code Created: I implemented the Q-Learning training loop, including features like exploration buffer systems, milestone-based epsilon decay, and dynamic batch size adjustments. Additionally, I designed the neural network architecture for approximating Q-values and incorporated experience replay to stabilize the learning process.

#### Reflections
Computer Science and Its Importance
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing algorithms, developing software, and leveraging computational methods. Their work is critical because it enables innovation across industries—from healthcare and education to entertainment and cybersecurity. This project ties directly into this broader field, as reinforcement learning is widely used in robotics, game development, and autonomous systems.

### Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking them into smaller, manageable components, identifying the constraints, and iterating toward optimal solutions. In this project, I applied this approach by:

### Defining the maze environment and constraints.
Decomposing the agent’s task into exploration, learning, and policy optimization.
Iteratively refining the model using feedback from performance metrics like win rates.
This structured mindset ensures efficiency and adaptability in solving complex challenges.

### Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities include:

Ensuring Safety: Developing AI systems with safeguards to prevent misuse, as seen in my implementation of balanced exploration to prevent erratic behavior.
Accountability: Designing transparent algorithms and documenting decisions to promote trust and reproducibility.

Respecting End Users: Building systems that prioritize user welfare and avoid harm, such as ensuring the agent’s decisions remain interpretable and align with intended outcomes.
In this project, careful consideration was given to developing a robust, ethical intelligent agent while balancing technical feasibility and end-user expectations.

### Key Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I:

Gained hands-on experience with reinforcement learning and neural networks.
Applied theoretical concepts like Q-Learning and experience replay to practical implementation.
Enhanced my understanding of ethical AI design and the role of iterative problem-solving in computer science.
This project is a valuable addition to my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to apply advanced AI concepts to solve meaningful problems.
